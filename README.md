# Make-a-Tish: Custom Tissue Box Website project

A website that allows its users to design their own custom tissue paper boxes. Created as a final project for CS320: UI/UX design in which teams were tasked to exchange and complete each others project proposals. 

- Uses HTML bootstrap and CSS for the front end, Flask and JavaScript for the backend.
- More emphasis was put in the UI/UX segment of this project.
