# Research and Needfinding notes

## Approaches existing in our domain

### 1) Vans Custom Shoes
Vans custom shoe portal offers users the opportunity to customize their very own shoes. Although this is not exactly a tissue box designing platform there are a couple of notable things.

### Some of the useful things from their website:
* Pre-existing layouts for users to start off their shoe designs or gain inspiration from.
* The way how the customization UI is ordered is something we can learn from and take inspiration from.
* The different shoe types that are offered as a design template can be useful if we are thinking of adding templates to start off tissue box designs.

### Some of the things that could use improvement:
* The design portal could probably use a first time optional tutorial so that would accommodate users that are new to the process of customizing their shoes online.
* The style of the editor could probably use some aesthetic improvements.

### 2) Nike Custom Air Force 1 portal

The Nike custom Air Force 1 design editor is also similar to the Vans Custom shoe editor however its UI and User experience is different.

### Some of the useful things from their website:
* It is another design option for us.
* Aesthetically much better than the Vans website.
* Checkout options easy to find and is a notable option that we might like to add
* The user experience in this website is notably different.

### Some of the things that could use improvement:
* Could use a first time tutorial for users that are new to custom design interfaces.

### 3) Papermart: Premium colored tissue papers
Papermart provides the service of colored tissue papers for their users, which is closer to our domain of customizable tissue papers and tissue boxes. The service they provide therefore is very notable to us.

### Some of the useful things from their website
* Their websites purpose aligns closely to ours, therefore we have a lot to learn from them
* Their design keeps things simple, everything is kept in a table with regards to specific information such as sizing, quantity and pricing.
* Notable in terms of simplicity

### Some of the things that could use improvement
* The design may be simple but it is rather dull and unattractive, when taking inspiration from this we need to note that we must balance appearance and simplicity when we work on our UI.
* Side bars have ads which are rather distracting to the users and might be annoying

### 4) Noissue
Noissue is a website that provides its users sustainable packaging which they can design themselves. Among their different categories of packaging tissue and wrapping along with customizable box designs.

### Some of the useful things from their website:
* Their UI is beautiful, its aesthetic, clean and organized.
* They have a little help box which users can use to voice usability issue they encounter.
* The way they present their customization options are amazing, they have balanced the right amount of aesthetics and details.
* Their tissue box/logo design editor is very clean in terms of design, they also offer similar options for customization that aligns with what our customers have asked from us.

### Some of the things that could use improvement
* Some of the website navigation could probably be improved
* There could perhaps be more options for customizing our tissues in the editor.
